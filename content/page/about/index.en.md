Hello, let me introduce myself. My name is Anas Fanani, usually called Anas. I am a technology enthusiast, especially in the field of Programming and Information Security.

I enjoy learning programming languages, especially for PHP, HTML, Javascript, Bash, and Python programming languages.

My hobbies besides learning programming languages and information security are reading articles, watching movies, and playing games. I also like to write articles on my personal blog, which you can read on this website.
